# Class 2

## To run

You'll need java installed. This was designed to work with Java 11. I don't care enough about Java to provide step by step how to install it properly and get this running.
All you need to know is that when you want to run the code, just type:

`cd src/`
To move into the source directory

For Task 1 - Locks associated to resources:

`javac Class2.java`
`java Class2`
