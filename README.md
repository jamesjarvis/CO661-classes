# CO661-classes

The University of Kent
CO661 - Theory and Practice of Concurrency (2019/2020)
This repository contains all of the CO661 class assignments and solutions as written by the contributors.

If you can't run the solutions despite having read the instructions - honestly tough luck.
If you can run it, but there are no instructions in the README's, then please submit a PR to add the solution.

If you are from the University of Kent, and have an issue with this being public, please reach out.
